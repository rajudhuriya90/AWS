## ☁️ My AWS Cloud Journey

I started learning AWS with a simple goal: to understand how real cloud systems are built and to create practical, scalable projects.  
Over time, I explored the core services of AWS and focused on learning through hands-on work.

### 🔹 What I’ve Mastered
- Compute, storage, and networking using services like **EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, and Load Balancers**  
- Serverless architecture with **Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS, and SNS**  
- Infrastructure design, security best practices, and monitoring with **CloudWatch**

### 🔹 Practical Cloud Building
I built multiple end-to-end cloud projects that involve:
- Full **serverless applications**
- **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy  
- **Secure networking** setups including VPN, private subnets, and routing  
- Modern architectures combining AWS services for real business use cases

### 🔹 My Approach
My AWS learning is driven by clarity, curiosity, and real implementation.  
Instead of just reading concepts, I design, deploy, break, fix, and optimize cloud systems myself.

### 🔹 What Defines My Cloud Journey
- Hands-on problem solving  
- Clear understanding of core services  
- Strong focus on real-world architecture  
- Continuous learning and experimentation

I believe in building things that work — reliable, scalable, secure, and simple.
